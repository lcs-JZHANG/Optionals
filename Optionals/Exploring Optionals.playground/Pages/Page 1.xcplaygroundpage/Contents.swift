 ## Variable initialization
 
 - Callout(Essential Question):
 What is the difference between an optional String and a regular String?
 
 ### Experiment #1
 Try typing the following code below on lines 19 and 20:
 
 ![declare-no-value](declare-no-value.png)
 
 Run the playground.
 
 What is the result?
 */
// Type the code below this line


/*:
 
 To see the result, open the debug area by pressing **Command-Shift-Y**.
 
 Scroll to the top of the output in the debug area.
 
 You should have seen output similar to the following:
 
 ![variable-not-initialized](error.png)
 
 ### Experiment #2
 
 Now comment out the code above from experiment #1.
 
 Then type the following instead:
 
 ![declare-optional](declare-optional.png)
 
 */
// Type the second code example below...


/*:
 
 Run the playground again.
 
 You will notice a warning appears:
 
 ![coerced](coerced.png)
 
 Aside from that warning, focus on the result shown in the debug area.
 
 How does the result shown from the second block of code differ from the result you got when running the first block of code?
 
 Write the answer in your app development journal.
